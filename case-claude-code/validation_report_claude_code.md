## 6. Test Predictions Analysis

### Final Predictions
| Essay ID | Predicted Score | Confidence Level |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 000d118  | 2              | Medium           |
| 000fe60  | 3              | High             |
| 001ab80  | 4              | Medium           |

### Prediction Distribution
- **Score 2**: 1 essay (33.3%)
- **Score 3**: 1 essay (33.3%)
- **Score 4**: 1 essay (33.3%)

**Analysis**: Predictions span the middle range of the score distribution, which aligns with the training data patterns where most essays fall in scores 2-4.
