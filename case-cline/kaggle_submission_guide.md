# Essay Scoring Model - Kaggle Submission Guide

## Model Summary

We have successfully trained an essay scoring model using the provided training data. Here's what was accomplished:

### Data Analysis
- **Training Data**: 17,307 essays with scores ranging from 1-6 (mean: 2.95)
- **Test Data**: 3 essays to predict scores for
- **Features**: essay_id, full_text (essay content), score (target)

### Model Approach
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - TF-IDF vectorization (1000 features, unigrams and bigrams)
   - Text preprocessing (lowercase, remove special characters)
   - Stop words removal

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Trained Ridge Regression model
   - Cross-validation RMSE: 0.7378
   - Used 3-fold cross-validation for model evaluation

3. **Predictions**:
   - Essay 000d118: Score 2
   - Essay 000fe60: Score 3
   - Essay 001ab80: Score 4

### Submission File
The final submission file `submission.csv` contains:
```
essay_id,score
000d118,2
000fe60,3
001ab80,4
```
